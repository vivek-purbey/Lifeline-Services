    <h1 style="color:azure;" id="carpenter"><center>About Carpentry:</center></h1>
    <h3><p style="background-color: aquamarine;">Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting, shaping and
        installation of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete 
        formwork , etc. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did rougher work such as framing,
        but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabibntmaking and furniture
        building are considered carpentry. Carpentry in the United States is historically defined similarly to the United
        Kingdom as the “heavier and stronger”[8] work distinguished from a joiner “...who does lighter and more 
        ornamental work than that of a carpenter...” although the “...work of a carpenter and joiner are often combined.” 
        Joiner is less common than the terms finish carpenter or cabinetmaker. The terms housewright and barn right were 
        used historically., now occasionally used by carpenters who work using traditional methods and materials. Someone 
        who builds custom concrete formwork is a form carpenter. Wood is one of mankind's oldest building materials. 
        The ability to shape wood improved with technological advances from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron 
        Age. Some of the oldest archaeological evidence of carpentry are water well casings. These include an oak and 
        hazel structure dating from 5256 BC, found in Ostrov, Czech Republic, and one built using split oak timbers 
        with mortise and tenon and notched corners excavated in eastern Germany, dating from about 7,000 years ago in 
        the early Neolithic period.</p></h3>
    <h1 style="color:azure;" id="electrician"><center>About Electrician:</center></h1>
    <h3><p style="background-color: aquamarine;">An electrician is a tradesman specializing in electrical wiring 
        of buildings, transmission lines, stationary machines, and related equipment. Electricians may be employed
         in the installation of new electrical components or the maintenance and repair of existing electrical infrastructure. 
         Electricians may also specialize in wiring ships, airplanes, and other mobile platforms, as well as data and 
         cable lines.In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: linemen, who work 
         on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the lower 
         voltages utilized inside buildings. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, 
         residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or 
         VDV. Other sub-specialties such as control wiring and fire-alarm may be performed by specialists trained in the 
         devices being installed, or by inside wiremen. Electricians are trained to one of three levels: Apprentice, 
         Journeyman, and Master Electrician. In the US and Canada, apprentices work and receive a reduced compensation 
         while learning their trade. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted 
         to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid 
         as a percentage of the Journeyman's pay. Journeymen are electricians who have completed their Apprenticeship and 
         who have been found by the local, State, or National licensing body to be competent in the electrical trade. Master 
         Electricians have performed well in the trade for a period of time, often seven to ten years, and have passed an 
         exam to demonstrate superior knowledge of the National Electrical Code, or NEC.</p></h3>
         <h1 style="color:azure;" id="plumber"><center>About Plumber:</center></h1>
         <h3><p style="background-color: aquamarine;">The word "plumber" dates from the Roman Empire. Roman roofs 
            used lead in conduits and drain pipes and some were also covered with lead; lead was also used for piping 
            and for making baths. The Latin for lead is plumbum. In medieval times, anyone who worked with lead was 
            referred to as a plumber; this can be seen from an extract about workmen fixing a roof in Westminster Palace; 
            they were referred to as plumbers: "To Gilbert de Westminster, plumber, working about the roof of the pantry 
            of the little hall, covering it with lead, and about various defects in the roof of the little hall". Thus a 
            person with expertise in working with lead was first known as a Plumbarius which was later shortened to plumber.
            Each state and locality may have its own licensing and taxing schemes for plumbers. Some states license 
            journeymen and master plumbers separately, while others license only master plumbers. To become licensed, 
            plumbers must meet standards for training and experience, and in most cases, pass a certification exam. 
            There is no federal law establishing licenses for plumbers. In Canada, licensing requirements differ by 
            province; however, the provinces have pooled resources to develop an Interprovincial Program Guide that 
            developed and now maintains apprenticeship training standards across all provinces. The Red Seal Program, 
            formally known as the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program, is a program that sets common standards to 
            assess the skills of tradespeople across Canada. The Red Seal, when affixed to a provincial or territorial trade 
            certificate, indicates that a tradesperson has demonstrated the knowledge required for the national standard in 
            that trade.</p></h3>
            <h1 style="color:azure;" id="cook"><center>About Cook:</center></h1>
            <h3><p style="background-color: aquamarine;">A cook is a profession for individuals who prepare food for 
            consumption in the food industry in settings such as restaurants. A cook is sometimes referred to as a 
            chef, although in the culinary world, the terms are not interchangeable. Cooks' responsibilities include 
            preparing food, managing food stations, cleaning the kitchen, and helping the chefs. Restaurants will give 
            a title to the cooks according to their designated stations. Examples are broiler cooks, fry cooks, pantry 
            cooks, and sauce cooks. The Cooks that prepared and cooked the food for those of the Chinese population that 
            were in the upper echelons of society and therefore could afford it, would operate through inns, restaurants 
            and even by roaming the streets as a street vendor, thus offering customers a variety of options. However, despite 
            the growing variety of foods and food sellers in Ming China, the services of most of the professional cooks was 
            reserved for the elite class. The Court was an extremely large employer of cooks throughout the entirety of 
            the Ming dynasty, with over 9,000 cooks employed in the 15th Century, the cooks in the employment of the court 
            would be expected to provide for around 10,000 to 15,000 people on a daily basis, including providing them all 
            with wine. Aside from just cooking food to be eaten, the court also employed around 1,800 cooks to prepare 
            sacrifices and offerings for rituals, around 200,000 animals were sacrificed yearly, including vast amounts of 
            geese, pigs, and sheep. Cooks would provide meals for merchants and landlords as well, but, they weren’t employed 
            at the same high rate as the cooks employed by the court. The merchants and landlords who could afford the luxury 
            of personally cooked food by a professional chef could usually expect a great quality and even extremely skill-heavy 
            and laborious types of cooking, for example baking and sugar animals.</p></h3>
            <h1 style="color:azure;" id="laundary"><center>About Laundary:</center></h1>
            <h3><p style="background-color: aquamarine;">Laundry refers to the washing of clothing and other textiles, and, 
            more broadly, their drying and ironing as well. Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, 
            so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several 
            branches of scholarship. Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, with the responsibility in most cultures 
            falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized 
            solutions to laundry work, notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer. Laundry, like cooking and child care, 
            is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home. The word "laundry" may refer to the clothing 
            itself, or to the place where the cleaning happens. An individual home may have a laundry room; a utility room includes 
            but is not restricted to the function of washing clothes. An apartment building or student hall of residence may have a 
            shared laundry facility such as a tvättstuga. A stand-alone business is referred to as a self-service laundry (launderette 
            in British English or laundromat in North American English). Laundry was first done in watercourses, letting the water carry 
            away the materials which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done this way in the rural regions of poor countries. 
            Agitation helps remove the dirt, so the laundry was rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. One name for this surface 
            is a beetling-stone, related to beetling, a technique in the production of linen; one name for a wooden substitute is a 
            battling-block. The dirt was beaten out with a wooden implement known as a washing paddle, battling stick, bat, beetle or 
            club. Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply were gradually replaced by portable rub boards, eventually 
            factory-made corrugated glass or metal washboards.</p></h3>
